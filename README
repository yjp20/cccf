This tool has three binaries:

* contest: tracks the contests participated by the members after a certain period
* leaderboard: generates a leaderboard based on codeforces rankings
* problems_solved: matches users to the problems solved

This is probably too specific for anybody to use other than me. Nevertheless it's up here on github.
